  ## [Description](#Contents)

  This project is designed to make creating README files a simpler process for developers. Users will not need to worry about markdown syntax and can focus simply on their content. This application will provide a series of questions that once answered, will be generated into a professional README.

  ## [Installation](#Contents)

  From this repository, download the zip file and add it to a directory of your choice. You also have the option of cloning the repository to a directory of your choice. The videos below demonstrate both of these circumstances. Once you have the files on your computer, open VS Code or any other coding editor. You can then run the app from the root directory of these files by running node index.js in your terminal.
